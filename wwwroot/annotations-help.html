<h1>Annotations</h1>

<p>Annotations to a track map are specified by text commands inserted into the
annotations text area of the viewer. A particular set of commands might look
like this:</p> <pre> Car @15.5 10 ^105 #aliceblue "Alan Rotoi" {'S *1} Split 1
@11 14 ^S *3 'N </pre> <p>There are currently three types of annotations
available: <code>Car</code>, <code>Seg</code>, <code>Split</code> and
<code>Trace</code>. These keywords inform the program the following values
should be taken as styling options of an annotation of the corresponding kind.
Most of the options are identified by leading symbols (<code>@</code>,
<code>^</code> etc.), which have roughly equivalent meanings for the different
annotations. In most cases, the options can be omitted (thus being replaced by
sensible defaults) and reordered freely. The syntax is quite liberal about
whitespace and linebreaks.</p> <p>The syntax and meaning of the fields for each
sort of annotation is described below. Mandatory fields are <code><span
class="anns-mandatory">highlighted</span></code>; fields whose position can not
be changed are <code><span class="anns-fixed">underlined</span></code>.</p>

<h2><code>Car</code></h2>

<code><span class="anns-fixed anns-mandatory">Car</span>
 <span class="anns-mandatory">@15.5 10</span>
 ^45 *0.5 #orange
 "Mark Nailwood" { #yellow $50 ^0 *0.5 'N }</code>

<p><code>Car</code> adds a car annotation, similar to the one used for the
0x02/0x03 ghost car track elements.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th><th>Option</th><th>Notes</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>@</td><td>Position</td>
    <td>Position of the car, in tile units with <code>@0 0</code> being the
      southwestern (i.e. lower left) corner of the map. To center the car in,
      say, the tile (15, 23) as displayed by the grid indices of the map, use
      <code>@15.5 23.5</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>^</td><td>Angle</td>
    <td>Angle in degrees of the direction the car points to, starting from east
      and growing counterclockwise (as per the usual convention in maths).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>*</td><td>Size</td>
    <td>Length of the car relative to tile size. The default value, 0.5, is the
      same used for the ghost car track elements.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>#</td><td>Colour</td>
    <td>Colour of the body of the car. Must be either one of the 147 colour
      names listed <a href=
        "http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/colour/2.3.3/doc/html/Data-Colour-Names.html">
        here</a> and typed as shown there (lower case, no spaces) or a hex
      RGB triplet (thus <code>#yellow</code> and <code>#ff00ff</code> are
      equivalent).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>"..." { }</td><td>Caption</td>
    <td>Text to be used as a caption, drawn beside the car. Within the (optional)
      curly braces styling options for the caption can be set.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

  <tr>
    <td>$</td><td>Background opacity</td>
    <td>Opacity of the caption background, from 0 to 100 (percent). The default

      the map colours make the caption hard to read.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>'</td><td>Caption and car alignment</td>
    <td>Alignment of the caption in relation to the car. The value must be one
      of <code>E</code>, <code>N</code>, <code>W</code> and <code>S</code>
      (which stand for the four cardinal directions).</td>

<h2><code>Seg</code></h2>

<code><span class="anns-fixed anns-mandatory">Seg</span>

 <span class="anns-mandatory">^90</span>
 <span class="anns-mandatory">*3.5</span>

<p><code>Seg</code> adds a line segment over the map.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th><th>Option</th><th>Notes</th>

<p>Other options work as described for <code>Car</code> above.

<h2><code>Split</code></h2>

 <span class="anns-mandatory">@22 14</span>

      the tile.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>^</td><td>Split direction</td>
    <td>Direction of the split line. One of <code>E</code>, <code>N</code>,
      <code>W</code> and <code>S</code>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

    <td>Opacity of the caption background, from 0 to 100 (percent).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>'</td><td>Caption and split alignment</td>

<h2><code>Trace</code></h2>

<code><span class="anns-fixed anns-mandatory">Trace</span>
  <span class="anns-mandatory">:"146zctg.dat"</span>
  #red !
  <!-- TODO: Add notation to indicate "conditionally mandatory" parameters -->
  + {Car @0 "CTG"}
  ~1 1 {Car}
  </code>

<p><code>Trace</code> adds the path of a replay, optionally decorated with car
annotations. The path is meant to be rendered from data extracted from a replay
(e.g. through dstien's repldump DOS tool) and formatted for reading with the
companion tool repldump-to-carto.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th><th>Option</th><th>Notes</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>:</td><td>Replay data path</td>
    <td>File containing the replay data. The path is relative to the base path
      set with the Cartography interface.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>#</td><td>Colour</td>
    <td>Colour of the trace; used as a default for cars and other decorations.
      The decorations may override the default colour with a <code>#</code>
      option of their own.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>!</td><td>Visibility</td>
    <td>Add an exclamation mark to make the trace line, but not cars or other
      decorations. invisible.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>+</td><td>Individual car decoration</td>
    <td>A car overlaid on some point of the path. Must be followed by the
      specification of a car annotation within curly brackets. The options for
      the overlaid car follow the syntax described above for regular car
      annotations, <strong>except for the position and angle
      annotations</strong>. The <code>@</code> position symbol should be
      followed by a single number, which sets at which moment of the lap should
      the car be positioned (for instance, <code>@7.5</code> will place the
      annotation on the position at 7.5s or, equivalently, the 150th frame).
      The angle annotation should be omitted, as the car will be placed
      according to the replay path orientation. Additionally, adding a caption
      to the car with the text <code>{{FRAMENUMBER}}</code> or
      <code>{{GAMETIME}}</code> will result in the frame number and the time in
      seconds of the frame, respectively, to be displayed automatically.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>~</td><td>Periodic car decoration</td>
    <td>Cars overlaid on the path at regular intervals. The symbol should be
      followed by two numbers, which set the initial moment and the spacing in
      seconds, and by a car annotation within curly brackets, using the syntax
      described above for individual car decorations (<code>+</code>).</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>Creating flipbooks</h2>

<p>A flipbook is a set of images, which, taken together, form an animation of
laps by one or several cars performing replays. To create a flipbook, specify
one or several trace annotations with periodic car overlays in the
<em>Flipbook</em> text area of the Cartography interface and render the map as
usual. After a while (rendering all frames will likely take a few minutes),
the link to save a flipbook will become active. The flipbook consists of a zip
file containing one PNG per replay frame, plus a background image with the
track map as well as any static annotations.</p>

<h3>Caveats and tips</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Regular annotations, such as split markers and stationary cars, can be
  added to a flipbook through the annotations text area.</li>
  <li>While the time interval parameter of the periodic car annotations can be
  used when generating a flipbook, one image will be generated for each point
  in the path; for intervals larger than 0.05, frames will be duplicated
  rather than skipped.</li>
  <li>Car overlays in a flipbook are scaled from the specified base size
  according to the height at each point taken from the replay data, so as to
  give some visual cues when jumps occur.</li>
  <li>The set of images can be converted into a video with the appropriate
  tools. For those familiar with ffmpeg, for instance, a sample command might
  be:
    <br>
    <code>ffmpeg -loop 1 -i backdrop.png -r 20 -i '0%04d.png'
      -filter_complex overlay -shortest -vcodec libx264 -frames 1329 -r 20
      foo.mp4</code>
  </li>
</ul>
