<p>Annotations to a track map are specified by text commands inserted into the
annotations text area of the viewer. A particular set of commands might look
like this:</p>

<code>Car @15.5 10 ^105 #aliceblue "Alan Rotoi" {'S *1} Split 1
@11 14 ^S *3 'N</code>

<p>The following types of annotations are currently
available: <code>Car</code>, <code>X</code>, <code>Circle</code>,
<code>Diamond</code>, <code>Dot</code>, <code>Arrow</code>,
<code>Text</code>, <code>Seg</code>, <code>Split</code> and <code>Trace</code>.
These keywords inform the program the following values
should be taken as styling options of an annotation of the corresponding kind.
Most of the options are identified by leading symbols (<code>@</code>,
<code>^</code> etc.), which have roughly equivalent meanings for the different
annotations. In most cases, the options can be omitted (thus being replaced by
sensible defaults) and reordered freely. The syntax is quite liberal about
whitespace and linebreaks.</p> <p>The syntax and meaning of the fields for each
sort of annotation is described below. Mandatory fields are
<code><span class="anns-mandatory">highlighted</span></code>; fields whose
position can not be changed are
<code><span class="anns-fixed">underlined</span></code>.</p>

<p><code>Car</code> adds a car annotation, similar to the one used for the
0x02/0x03 ghost car track elements.</p>

<p><code>X</code>, <code>Circle</code>, <code>Diamond</code>,
<code>EqTriangle</code>, <code>Dot</code> and <code>Arrow</code> can be used to
add general purpose markers to the map. The syntax and available settings are
the same as those for <code>Car</code>, with a few additional options for some
of the markers: <code>Arrow</code> accepts an optional <code>%</code> setting
which inverts the direction of the arrow. Arrows by default start at their
location, as specified through <code>@</code>. With <code>%</code>, the arrow
will end at the <code>@</code>-location and start at what would, without the
<code>%</code>, have been its end point.</p>

<p>Note that in their default orientations <code>EqTriangle</code> points to
the right and <code>Diamond</code> has its longer side laid out vertically.</p>

<p><code>Text</code> adds a standalone caption. The options are the same as

<p><code>Trace</code> adds the path of a replay, optionally decorated with car
annotations. The path is meant to be rendered from data extracted from a replay

<h3 id="trace-caption-substitutions">Adding car and frame information to captions</h3>

Captions of trace decorations can be made to display information about the game

  <tr>

  </tr>

<h3 id="trace-caption-types">Types of frame decoration captions</h3>

<p>Both individual and periodic trace decorations support captions through the
syntax described in the section about car annotations. A couple of examples:</p>

<p><code>Trace :"070ZGUT.dat" #plum +{Car @20 "{{SPEED}}" {$50}}</code></p>

<p>An individual car anotation at the 0:20.00 frame with an associated
caption, positioned next to the car.</p>

<p><code>Trace :"070ZGUT.dat" #plum ~0 5 {Car "{{SPEED}}" {$50}} </code></p>

<p>A periodic car annotation, added every five seconds starting from the
0:00.00 frame, with an associated caption, positioned next to each car.</p>

<p>Individual decorations support an alternative form of caption, introduced
using the full syntax for standalone <code>Text</code> annotations within
<code>&amp;&nbsp;{&nbsp;}</code>:

<p><code>Trace :"070ZGUT.dat" #plum +{Car @20 &amp;{Text "{{SPEED}}" @2 29 $50}}</code></p>

<p>The specification above will result in a periodic car annotation in which
each annotation is accompanied by a caption. The caption, however, is not
placed next to the car, but rather at the position specified by
<code>@</code> (in this case, at coordinates <code>(2, 29)</code>). Such an
arrangement, which will be referred from now on as <em>frame-bound standalone
captions</em>, makes it possible to display car and frame information at fixed
positions on the map.</p>

<p>Unlike in the case of regular captions, there can be multiple frame-bound
standalone captions per decoration:</p>

<p><code>Trace :"070ZGUT.dat" #plum +{Car @20 &amp;{Text "{{SPEED}}mph" @2 29 $50}
  &amp;{Text "Gear: {{GEAR}}" @2 27 $50}}</p></code>

<p>Frame-bound standalone captions for periodic decorations are only allowed
in flipbook rendering, as described in the next section, with a slightly
different syntax.</p>

<h2 id="creating-flipbooks">Creating flipbooks</h2>

<p>A flipbook is a set of images, which, taken together, form an animation of
laps by one or several cars performing replays. To create a flipbook, specify
one or several trace annotations with periodic overlays in the
<em>Flipbook</em> text area of the Cartography interface and render the map as
usual. After a while (rendering all frames will likely take a few minutes),
the link to save a flipbook will become active. The flipbook consists of a zip
file containing one PNG per replay frame, plus a background image with the
track map as well as any static annotations.</p>

<h3 id="flipbook-tips">Caveats and tips</h3>
<ul>
  <li><p>Regular annotations, such as split markers, stationary cars and
  unchanging standalone captions, can be added to a flipbook through the
  annotations text area.</p></li>

  <li><p>Periodic overlays in trace flipbooks can have frame-bound standalone
    captions, so that frame information can be displayed at fixed positions.
    As described in the subsection about frame decoration captions, they are
    introduced through <code>&amp;&nbsp;{&nbsp;}</code>, with the difference
    that the caption specification should be next outside of, but next to, the
    braces of the periodic decoration. For instance, here is an example with a
    timer:</p>

  <p><code>Trace :"070ZGUT.dat" #plum ! ~0 0.05 {Car} &amp; {Text "{{GAMETIME}}" @2 29 $50}
   </code></p>

  <p>If this feature is used to add a timer to a flipbook with multiple traces,
  the timer should be added to the longest trace, as otherwise the timer will
  remain frozen for the final frames, after the trace ends.</p></li>

  <li><p>While the time interval parameter of the periodic annotations can be
  used when generating a flipbook, one image will be generated for each point
  in the path; for intervals larger than 0.05, frames will be duplicated
  rather than skipped.</p></li>

  <li><p>Overlays in a flipbook are scaled from the specified base size
  according to the height at each point taken from the replay data, so as to
  give some visual cues when jumps occur.</p></li>

  <li><p>The set of images can be converted into a video with the appropriate
  tools. Using <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/">FFmpeg</a>, for instance, a sample
  command might be:</p>

  <p>
  <code>ffmpeg -loop 1 -i backdrop.png -r 20 -i '0%04d.png'
    -filter_complex overlay -shortest -vcodec libx264 -frames 1329 -r 20
    foo.mp4</code>
  </p>

  <p>(In the above, <code>1329</code> should be replaced by the actual number
  of frames in the flipbook.)</p></li>
</ul>
