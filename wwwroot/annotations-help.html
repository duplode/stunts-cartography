<h1>Annotations</h1>

<p>Annotations to a track map are specified by text commands inserted into the
annotations text area of the viewer. A particular set of commands might look
like this:</p>

<code>Car @15.5 10 ^105 #aliceblue "Alan Rotoi" {'S *1} Split 1
@11 14 ^S *3 'N</code>

<p>The following types of annotations are currently
available: <code>Car</code>, <code>X</code>, <code>Circle</code>,
<code>Diamond</code>, <code>Dot</code>, <code>Arrow</code>,
<code>Text</code>, <code>Seg</code>, <code>Split</code> and <code>Trace</code>.
These keywords inform the program the following values
should be taken as styling options of an annotation of the corresponding kind.
Most of the options are identified by leading symbols (<code>@</code>,
<code>^</code> etc.), which have roughly equivalent meanings for the different
annotations. In most cases, the options can be omitted (thus being replaced by
sensible defaults) and reordered freely. The syntax is quite liberal about
whitespace and linebreaks.</p> <p>The syntax and meaning of the fields for each
sort of annotation is described below. Mandatory fields are
<code><span class="anns-mandatory">highlighted</span></code>; fields whose
position can not be changed are
<code><span class="anns-fixed">underlined</span></code>.</p>

<h2><code>Car</code></h2>

<code><span class="anns-fixed anns-mandatory">Car</span>
 <span class="anns-mandatory">@15.5 10</span>
 ^45 *0.5 #orange
 "Mark Nailwood" { #yellow $50 ^0 *0.5 'N % }</code>

<p><code>Car</code> adds a car annotation, similar to the one used for the
0x02/0x03 ghost car track elements.</p>

  <tr>
    <td>@</td><td>Position</td>
    <td>Position of the car, in tile units with <code>@0 0</code> being the
      southwestern (i.e. lower left) corner of the map. To center the car in,
      say, the tile (15, 23) as displayed by the grid indices of the map, use
      <code>@15.5 23.5</code></td>

    <td>Length of the car relative to tile size. The default value, 0.5, is the
      same used for the ghost car track elements.</td>

      RGB triplet (thus <code>#yellow</code> and <code>#ff00ff</code> are
      equivalent).</td>

      of <code>E</code>, <code>N</code>, <code>W</code> and <code>S</code>
      , which stand for the four cardinal directions. The alignment is defined
      as if the car faced eastward, so <code>E</code> will draw the text ahead
      of the car, <code>N</code> to its left, and so forth.</td>

<p><code><span class="anns-fixed anns-mandatory">Arrow</span>
 <span class="anns-mandatory">@3 15</span>
 *1 ^45 #yellow</code> %</p>

<p><code>X</code>, <code>Circle</code>, <code>Diamond</code>, <code>Dot</code>
and <code>Arrow</code> can be used to add general purpose markers to the map.
The syntax and available settings are the same as those for
<code>Car</code>, with a few additional options for some of the markers: <code>Arrow</code> accepts an optional
<code>%</code> setting which inverts the direction of the arrow. Arrows by
default start at their location, as specified through <code>@</code>. With
<code>%</code>, the arrow will end at the <code>@</code>-location and start
at what would, without the <code>%</code>, have been its end point.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th><th>Option</th><th>Available for</th><th>Notes</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>%</td><td>Inversion</td><td><code>Arrow</code></code>
    <td>Exchanges the start and end points of the arrow, so that it ends, and
      points at, the location specified by <code>@</code>, rather than
      beginning at it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&gt;</td><td>Line width</td><td><code>Arrow</code>, <code>Circle</code> and
    <code>X</code></td>
    <td>Line width of the marker, in tiles. Note that, for arrows, the length
      of the arrow head is five times its line width.</td>

<h2><code>Text</code></h2>

<code><span class="anns-fixed anns-mandatory">Text "Hello!"</span>
 <span class="anns-mandatory">@9 10</span>
 ^45 *0.5 #blue $50</code>

<p><code>Text</code> adds a standalone caption. The options are the same as
those described for car captions, except for there being no alignment
setting, and for there being a <code>@</code> position setting which
specifies where the left edge of the caption will be.</p>

<h2><code>Seg</code></h2>

<code><span class="anns-fixed anns-mandatory">Seg</span>
 <span class="anns-mandatory">@17.5 10.25</span>
 <span class="anns-mandatory">^90</span>
 <span class="anns-mandatory">*3.5</span>

<p><code>Seg</code> adds a line segment over the map.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th><th>Option</th><th>Notes</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>@</td><td>Position</td>
    <td>Position of one of the ends of the segment.</td>

    <td>Angle in degrees of the direction of the segment, starting from the
      coordinates defined by <code>@</code>.</td>

<p>Other options work as described for <code>Car</code> above.</p>

<h2><code>Split</code></h2>

<code><span class="anns-fixed anns-mandatory">Split</span>
 <span class="anns-fixed anns-mandatory">1</span>
 <span class="anns-mandatory">@7 14</span>
 <span class="anns-mandatory">^E</span>
 <span class="anns-mandatory">*5</span>
 #yellow $40 'W</code>

<p><code>Split</code> adds a split / section marker, drawn as a segment with
specialised properties.</p>

<table>
  <tr>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$</td><td>Caption background opacity</td>
    <td>Opacity of the caption background, from 0 to 100 (percent).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>'</td><td>Caption and split alignment</td>
    <td>Alignment of the caption in relation to the split line. Must be one
      of <code>E</code>, <code>N</code>, <code>W</code> and <code>S</code>.
      </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>%</td><td>Caption text inversion</td>

<h2><code>Trace</code></h2>

<code><span class="anns-fixed anns-mandatory">Trace</span>

  #plum !
  <!-- TODO: Add notation to indicate "conditionally mandatory" parameters -->
  + {Car @0 "GUT"}
  ~1 1 {Car}
  </code>

<p><code>Trace</code> adds the path of a replay, optionally decorated with car
annotations. The path is meant to be rendered from data extracted from a replay
(e.g. through dstien's repldump DOS tool) and formatted for reading with the
companion tool repldump-to-carto.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Syntax</th><th>Option</th><th>Notes</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>

    <td>File containing the replay data. The path is relative to the base path
      set with the Cartography interface.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>#</td><td>Colour</td>
    <td>Colour of the trace; used as a default for cars and other decorations.
      The decorations may override the default colour with a <code>#</code>
      option of their own.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>!</td><td>Visibility</td>
    <td>Add an exclamation mark to make the trace line, but not cars or other
      decorations, invisible.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>+ { }</td><td>Individual car/marker decoration</td>
    <td>An annotation overlaid on some point of the path. Must be followed by
      the specification of a car or marker annotation within curly brackets.
      The options for the overlaid annotation follow the syntax described above
      for regular annotations, <strong>except for the position and angle
      annotations</strong>. The <code>@</code> position symbol should be
      followed by a single number, which sets at which moment of the lap should
      the annotation be positioned (for instance, <code>@7.5</code> will place
      the annotation on the position at 7.5s or, equivalently, the 150th frame).
      The angle annotation should be omitted, as the annotation will be placed
      according to the replay path orientation. Additionally,
      <code>{{FRAMENUMBER}}</code> and <code>{{GAMETIME}}</code> in the
      caption text will be replaced by the frame number and the time in seconds
      of the frame respectively.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>~ { }</td><td>Periodic car/marker decoration</td>
    <td>Annotations overlaid on the path at regular intervals. The symbol should
      be followed by two numbers, which set the initial moment and the spacing
      in seconds, and by a car or marker annotation within curly brackets, using
      the syntax described above for individual decorations
      (<code>+</code>).</td>

<h2 id="creating-flipbooks">Creating flipbooks</h2>

<p>A flipbook is a set of images, which, taken together, form an animation of
laps by one or several cars performing replays. To create a flipbook, specify
one or several trace annotations with periodic overlays in the
<em>Flipbook</em> text area of the Cartography interface and render the map as
usual. After a while (rendering all frames will likely take a few minutes),
the link to save a flipbook will become active. The flipbook consists of a zip
file containing one PNG per replay frame, plus a background image with the
track map as well as any static annotations.</p>

<h3>Caveats and tips</h3>
<ul>
  <li><p>Regular annotations, such as split markers, stationary cars and
  unchanging standalone captions, can be added to a flipbook through the
  annotations text area.</p></li>

  <li><p>Periodic overlays in trace flipbooks can have an associated caption
  which is redrawn each frame so that frame information can be displayed
  through them. Such a caption is specified as a text annotation within
  <code>&amp; { }</code> after the periodic overlay specification. For
  instance, here is an example with a timer:</p>

  <p><code>Trace :"070ZGUT.dat" #plum ! ~0 0.05 {Car} &amp; {Text "{{GAMETIME}}" @2 29 $50}
   </code></p>

  <p>If this feature is used to add a timer to a flipbook with multiple traces,
  the timer should be added to the longest trace, as otherwise the timer will
  remain frozen for the final frames, after the trace ends.
  added to a flipbook through the annotations text area.</p></li>

  <li><p>While the time interval parameter of the periodic annotations can be
  used when generating a flipbook, one image will be generated for each point
  in the path; for intervals larger than 0.05, frames will be duplicated
  rather than skipped.</p></li>

  <li><p>Overlays in a flipbook are scaled from the specified base size
  according to the height at each point taken from the replay data, so as to
  give some visual cues when jumps occur.</p></li>

  <li><p>The set of images can be converted into a video with the appropriate
  tools. Using <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/">FFmpeg</a>, for instance, a sample
  command might be:</p>

  <p>
  <code>ffmpeg -loop 1 -i backdrop.png -r 20 -i '0%04d.png'
    -filter_complex overlay -shortest -vcodec libx264 -frames 1329 -r 20
    foo.mp4</code>
  </p>

  <p>(In the above, <code>1329</code> should be replaced by the actual number
  of frames in the flipbook.)</p></li>
</ul>
