# Stunts Cartography - Win32 build

* Included executables: sc-trk-viewer.exe (vectorial track viewer) and
  repldump2carto.exe (lap trace extractor).

* Usage: copy this whole directory somewhere (the best place likely being your
  Stunts directory), launch the executable, authorize it if the Windows
  Firewall dialog shows up, and navigate in a browser to
  http://localhost:8023 . More detailed usage notes are in the README.md
  (for the track viewer) and REPLDUMP.md (for the repldump2carto tool), which
  can be opened by Notepad or any other text editor.

* Browsers: we recommend you to use the most recent version of your browser of
  choice. If you use Internet Explorer, you will need at least IE10, as
  support for WebSockets is required. Firefox and Chrome users should be fine
  with somewhat older browser versions (Firefox 11+, Chrome 16+).
