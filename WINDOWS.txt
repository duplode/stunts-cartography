# Stunts Cartography - Win32 build

* Included executables: sc-trk-viewer.exe (vectorial track viewer) and
  repldump2carto.exe (lap trace extractor).

* Usage: copy this whole directory somewhere (the best place likely being your
  Stunts directory), launch the executable, authorize it if the Windows
  Firewall dialog shows up, and navigate in a browser to
  http://localhost:10000 . More detailed usage notes are in the README.md
  (for the track viewer) and REPLDUMP.md (for the repldump2carto tool), which
  can be opened by Notepad or any other text editor.

* Browsers: we recommend you to use the most recent version of your browser of
  choice. Still, most features are compatible with any sensible version of the
  mainstream GUI browsers. The only exception currently is SVG display in
  Internet Explorer 8 or earlier.
