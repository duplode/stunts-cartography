# Stunts Cartography - Win64 build

* Included executable: stcarto.exe

* Usage: copy this whole directory somewhere (the best place likely being your
  Stunts directory), launch the viewer (use the following command: stcarto
  viewer), authorize it if the Windows Firewall dialog shows up, and navigate
  in a browser to http://localhost:8023 . More detailed usage notes are in
  README.md and REPLDUMP.md (for the r2c command), which can be opened by
  Notepad or any other text editor.

* Browsers: we recommend you to use the most recent version of your browser of
  choice. If you use Internet Explorer, you will need at least IE10, as
  support for WebSockets is required. Firefox and Chrome users should be fine
  with somewhat older browser versions (Firefox 11+, Chrome 16+).
