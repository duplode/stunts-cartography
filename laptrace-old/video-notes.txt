Once the PNG frames are generated, build the video with ffmpeg. The following
command generates a nice and small MP4 video. Obviously, you may need to
adjust the file name format if there are more than 9999 or less than 1000
frames:

ffmpeg -r 30 -i 'frame%04d.png' -vcodec libx264 -r 30 070zgut_aerial.mp4

For some reason, however, YouTube does not play well with such an encoding.
One option is switching to the ZMBV codec - the same one used by DOSBox for
video captures - which results in reasonably good-looking and not too large
output:

ffmpeg -r 30 -i 'frame%04d.png' -vcodec zmbv -vf "scale=720:720,pad=1280:720:280:0" -s hd720 -r 30 070zgut_aerial_zh.avi

The command above, incidentally, was used to generate the tech demo at:
