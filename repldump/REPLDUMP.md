repldump2carto
==============

The repldump directory in the source code repository contains the source tree
of the repldump2carto tool and related files. repldump2carto is a command line
tool which extracts car coordinates from binary game state dumps generated by
dstien's repldump (see e.g. [the Southern Cross downloads
page](http://scr.stunts.hu/mods.html) for more info) to tabular plain text
files in a format appropriate for setting up lap trace annotations in Stunts
Cartography. The tool is very rustic: simply pass one or more input file paths
as arguments and the corresponding plain text files, with a .dat extension,
will be created in the directory of the input files.

In addition to repldump2carto, we provide two sample files which may be of help
in setting a workflow for convenient replay data processing. The repldump.sh
bash script (translating it to DOS batch or PowerShell is left as an exercise
to the reader) will, given a replay file as argument, run repldump via DOSBox
on it, provided that there are both a Stunts folder with repldump and the
provided repldump.conf DOSBox configuration file lying in the working
directory.

The source tree of repldump2carto was forked from the
[stunts-repldump-analysis](https://bitbucket.org/duplode/stunts-repldump-analysis)
project at changeset 4abacd04bd01a2efb7491194f2759bb16d89e0f1 .
