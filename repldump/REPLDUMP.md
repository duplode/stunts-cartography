repldump2carto
==============

The repldump directory in the source code repository contains the source tree
of the repldump2carto tool and related files. repldump2carto is a command line
tool which extracts car coordinates from binary game state dumps generated by
dstien's repldump (see e.g. [the Southern Cross downloads
page](http://scr.stunts.hu/mods.html) for more info) to tabular plain text
files in a format appropriate for setting up lap trace annotations in Stunts
Cartography. The tool is very rustic: simply pass one or more input file paths
as arguments and the corresponding plain text files, with a .dat extension,
will be created in the directory of the input files.

In addition to repldump2carto, we provide a few sample files which may be of
help in setting a workflow for convenient replay data processing. The
repldump.sh and repldump.bat scripts (for Linux and Windows respectively) will,
given a replay file as argument, run repldump via DOSBox on it, provided that
there are both a Stunts folder (named STUNTS and containing repldump) and the
provided repldump.conf (a DOSBox configuration file) lying in the working
directory. The scripts are meant as suggestions, to be checked and eventually
adjusted before running; in particular, you may have to adjust the DOSBox path
in the batch script.

The source tree of repldump2carto was forked from the
[stunts-repldump-analysis](https://bitbucket.org/duplode/stunts-repldump-analysis)
project at changeset 4abacd04bd01a2efb7491194f2759bb16d89e0f1 .
